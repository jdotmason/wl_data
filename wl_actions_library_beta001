"howTo": "Find a confortable, quiet place, and set a timer for 5, 10, or 20 minutes. \r\rThink of a word that makes you think of God’s presence. (e.g. God, Presence, Love, etc.) \r\rClose your eyes and quietly focus on the reality that God is present with you——all around you, and within you. Let the weight or fullness of God's presence fill your senses, similar to how it feels to close your eyes and point your face toward the sun.\r\rAs your mind wanders, say your word, gently bring your attention back to God’s presence and let your thoughts float away, as if you're watching a ship sail out of view. ",
"tips":"Centering prayer helps you work the inner 'muscle' of noticing God’s presence above all else. You may not feel different right away, but notice if your awareness of God increases at other points in your day as you practice centering prayer regularly over time.\r\rSome people find that after practicing centering prayer over time, they need a bit less sleep because the brain finds centering prayer restful (source: A Centered Life, Basil Pennington).",
