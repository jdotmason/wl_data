You may not feel different right away, but notice if your awareness of God increases at other points in your day as you practice centering prayer regularly over time.\r\rSome people find that after practicing centering prayer over time, they need a bit less sleep because the brain finds centering prayer restful (source: A Centered Life, Basil Pennington).",

If you were right, they may come to accept their resemblance to Jesus later. But you can also ask if you're off-base or why they don't think it's true.

Jesus recognized that every person is made in the image of God and that life history or humble circumstances, like crumpling a $100 bill, cannot take away their inherent worth. He saw beyond what makes society look down on them, to the essence of who he created them to be in eternity. /r/rSpend time with people society or your community looks down on, and ask God to help you see them through Jesus' eyes. /r/rNotice their uniqueness, their aspirations, or aspects of their humanity that you identify with. /r/rShare with someone else about your day or your experience, and try describing the people you spent time with first by their unique qualities or aspirations, not at first by what makes them marginalized. For example, 'I met this guy today with this amazing sense of humor. He wants to find a peaceful home and this is the obstacle he's facing' rather than 'I met a homeless guy today'.",

If you're thoughts are elsewhere, reading a Psalm can help you focus your spirit on God's presence. /r/rShare with God anything that concerns you, what you're thankful for, or what you're learning. Leave lots of space and quiet to calm your heart and body and to listen for anything the Spirit may stir in your heart, either reasurances, wisdom, leading to what's next, or additional things that you and God need to deal with together. /r/rNotice any ways the natural setting opens you up to God in a special way. /r/rYou can also imagine some of what Jesus might have felt as he withdrew to be with God outdoors.",
