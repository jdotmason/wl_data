"question":"Can I use this app without a group?",
"answer":"The app guides a shared experience, including conversations.  \r\rIt's designed for use by pods of 2-4 (including you), so feel free to use it for on-on-one conversations. \r\rWhile you could use the app just for spiritual photo journaling without others, the goal for the app is to guide relational Bible reading, story sharing, and mutual support our spiritual journeys.",

"question":"Where do the conversations (convos) happen?",
"answer":"Your conversations happen in real life——in person, over video, or phone.   \r\rThe app guides conversations, it doesn't replace them.",

"question":"How many people are in a group/pod?",
"answer":"Pods (groups) have 2-4 people, including you.   \r\rThis size makes space for everyone to share their stories and allows spiritual mentoring to be personal.",

"question":"Can I add a photo from the internet to my PhotoJournal?",
"answer":"Find the photo you like in your phone's internet browser.   \r\rTake a screenshot by pressing the phone's right button and volume up button at the same time.   \r\rCrop the screenshot down to the image you want.  \r\rSave it to your photos.  \r\rIn the Whole Life app, in the Add Entry page, select Photo Library to find your new screenshot.",

"question":"How do I delete unwanted items?",
"answer":"DELETE A PHOTJOURNAL ENTRY \r\rGo to the PhotoJournal tab and tap the list icon in the top right. Find the item you want to delete, and swipe left.  \r\rDELETE AN ACTION \r\rGo to the Actions tab and tap the list icon in the top right. Go to either the Past Action or My Custom Action Ideas Page, find the item you want to delete, and swipe left. NOTE: Each active action is a unique copy of the original action idea, which you can alter. If you want to delete the active copy as well, tap on the action to get into its detail page, tap Edit in the top right, change the status to Done, and tap Done in the top right. Now you will find the action in the Past Actions, and you can delete it from there.  \r\rDELETE A PERSON OR POD\r\rYou first need to archive them as inactive. Active persons or pods are protected from deletion.   \r\rFor a PERSON, tap on the person's face to get to the person's detail view.    \r\rTap Edit.   \r\rScroll to the bottom and check 'Archive Person as Inactive'.  \r\rGo to the People Tab and tap the list icon in the top left.   \r\rFind the person you want to delete and swipe left.  \r\rTo delete a POD, do the same as a person, but go to the pod's detail view instead of the person to find 'Archive This Square As Inactive.'\r\rNOTE: If you delete a pod or person, you will lose your entire history with them. We recommend you only delete persons or pods that are 'junk' or were entered in error. You don't need to delete an inactive person or pod if you might meet with them later. Inactive persons and pods are hidden so they won't clutter up your views.",

"question":"How often do pods meet?",
"answer":"At least twice a month. Less often than that and it's difficult to develop a good connection and avoid spending most of your time catching up. /r/rIf you're able, meeting in person each time is great. If this is not possible, you might choose to do the main convo in person and the followup over video call. If you're remote, you could have both over video call. /r/rMeeting sometimes over video call may help if consistency is a problem.",

"question":"How can I use Instagram with this app?",
"answer":"For Instagram posts saved in your camera roll, tap Photo Library when you add an entry to your Whole Life photojournal. \r\rFor an Instagram story, go into the Story Settings and turn on Save Story to Camera Roll. Then in Whole Life, tap Photo Library when adding an entry to your photojournal. \r\rFuture releases will enable Share To... in Instagram to send directly to the Whole Life photojournal and vice versa.",

{
"id":"faq008",
"question":"Why is the app called Whole Life?",
"answer":"First, I wanted to create an app that allowed for spiritual growth conversation about every aspect of life. The twenty topics are intended to cover our whole lives so that there's no aspect of living as a follower of Jesus that users don't have a place to talk about. \r\rSecond, I believe that we find whole life, or fullness of life, as we grow in relationship with God, one another, and the created world.\r\rThis app is not affiliated with the whole life movement.",
