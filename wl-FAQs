"question":"Can I use this app without a group?",
"answer":"The app guides a shared experience, including conversations.  \r\rWhile you could use the app just for spiritual photo journaling without a group, the goal for the app is to guide relational Bible reading, story sharing, and mutual support our spiritual journeys.",

"question":"How do I delete unwated items?",
"answer":"If it's a photojournal entry or action, go to the corresponding tab and tap the list icon in the top right. Find the item you want to delete, and swipe left.  \r\rTo delete a person or a pod, you first need to archive them as inactive.   \r  For a person, tap on the person's face to get to the person's detail view.    \rTap Edit.   \rScroll to the bottom and check 'Archive Person as Inactive'.  \rYou can now delete as above by going to the People Tab and tap the list icon in the top left.   \rFind the person you want to delete and swipe left.   \rNOTE: You don't need to delete an inactive person if you might meet with them later.   \r\rTo delete a pod, do the same as a person, but go to the pod's detail view instead of the person to find 'Archive This Square As Inactive.'",
